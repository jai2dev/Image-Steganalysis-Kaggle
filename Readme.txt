Note: We have used kaggle for executing and developing of the project as the project requires GPU for its execution. So it was not affordable and also keeping in mind the size of the dataset, the model will take years to train on a normal pc. Further the dataset used is too large (around 30 gb in size) so we have included a portion of the dataset in the folder.


Platform : Kaggle
Machine Learning Framework : Pytorch


The Code folder contains two code files

First one is Exploratory data analysis. It is for analyzing the dataset.

Second one is Developing the model and preprocessing the data. This is the main program that will produce the output




1) Make a new notebook in Kaggle 

2) Upload the files in the Code folder to the notebook and the dataset

3) Enable GPU as an accelerator

4) Further run the notebook code snippetes step by step for the execution
